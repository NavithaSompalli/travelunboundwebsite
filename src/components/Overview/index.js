        November is one of the Best times to visit Kenya, especially to visit
        its prime park, Maasai Mara. This is because the large migratory herds
        would have returned to Tanzania and now the Big cats have to venture
        long distances to hunt their prey. <br />
        <br />
        November is also the season of short rains. This makes the plains of
        Maasai Mara lush green. The skies are truly dramatic and colourful. The
        Sun rise and Sun sets during November at Mara is simply breath taking.{' '}
        <br />
        <br />
        November is also a time for holidaying and getting together with our
        families. And the icing on the cake is we have curated this itinerary
        for such an affordable costs without compromising on any of the
        services. This is commemorate our first year anniversary of opening up
        operations at Nairobi.
        <br />
        <br />
